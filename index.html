        <h5 class=text-muted>St. Joseph’s Convent school is a Christian minority school under the Management of the CMC sisters, a religious order founded in Kerala in 1866, in order to impart education especially to women and children. Ever since its Origin, the sisters have been active in the field of education. The lives of many young girls and boys, belonging to different classes and religious communities and linguistic groups are being shaped and molded in these institutions.

            Opened in 1972, St. Joseph’s Convent School is affiliated to the Council for the Indian Certificate School Examination which has statutory recognition of the Government of India as one of the main All India School Examination bodies. The school receives no Government and private aid and fee is its only income. Hence, fee has to be adjusted from time to time to keep up with the rising costs and salaries. The running of the day to day activities of the school is invested in the Principal.</h5>
